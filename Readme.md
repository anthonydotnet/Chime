# üçÉ Chime - Umbraco Starter Kit

Chime is an opinionated Umbraco Starter Kit based on Tailwind CSS. It is intended to use as a starting point for new Umbraco projects that want to use Tailwind CSS.

## What is the purpose of this repo?

This repository is for the development of the starter kit. You can not install Chime with this repository. This repository houses only the source files for the Chime project.

## Technologies used

- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Alpine JS via CDN

Note: to keep it as portable as possible I made the decision to include the CDN version of Tailwind CSS. This is not optimal as Tailwind CSS comes with many classes by default. The ideal situation would be to make your own buildproces when using Chime in production. You can read more about it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size) in the official documentation.
